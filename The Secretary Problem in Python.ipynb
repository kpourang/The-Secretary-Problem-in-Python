    "<p>The secretary problem is a famous problem that demonstrates a scenario involving the optimal stopping theory. The problem has been studied extensively in the fields of applied probability, statistics, and decision theory. It is also known as the marriage problem, the sultan's dowry problem, the fussy suitor problem, the googol game, and the best choice problem. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The basic form of the problem is the following: imagine an administrator who wants to hire the best secretary out of n rankable applicants for a position. The applicants are interviewed one by one in random order. A decision about each particular applicant is to be made immediately after the interview. Once rejected, an applicant cannot be recalled. During the interview, the administrator can rank the applicant among all applicants interviewed so far but is unaware of the quality of yet unseen applicants. The question is about the optimal strategy (stopping rule) to maximize the probability of selecting the best applicant. The difficulty is that the decision must be made immediately. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The problem has an elegant solution, proving that the optimal win probability is always at least 1/e. The optimal stopping rule prescribes always rejecting the first 1/e % applicants that are interviewed at the look stage, and then stopping at the first applicant who is better than every applicant interviewed so far at the commit stage. One reason why the secretary problem has received so much attention is that the optimal policy for the problem (the stopping rule) is simple and selects the single best candidate about 37% of the time, irrespective of whether there are 100 or 100 million applicants. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em><b>e</b></em> is the base of the natural logarithm.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Although there are many variations, the basic problem can be stated as follows:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>There is a single position to fill.</li>\n",
    "    <li>There are n applicants for the position, and the value of n is known.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The applicants, if seen altogether, can be ranked from best to worst unambiguously.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The applicants are interviewed sequentially in random order, with each order being equally likely.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Immediately after an interview, the interviewed applicant is either accepted or rejected, and the decision is irrevocable. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The decision to accept or reject an applicant can be based only on the relative ranks of the applicants interviewed so far. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The objective of the general solution is to have the highest probability of selecting the best applicant of the whole group. This is the same as maximizing the expected payoff, with payoff defined to be one for the best applicant and zero otherwise.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To prove that this solution is optimal, we need to build a trial that should be executed 1,000 times and count the number of successes.</p>"
